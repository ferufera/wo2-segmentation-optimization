Below you will find a full transcript of an interview in Dutch with timestamps in seconds. 
Split this transcript into relevant segments according to the following rules:

Rule 1: A segment is based on the following definition: A segment is a coherent portion of an interview that focuses on questions related to one main topic or theme, usually introduced by a question from the interviewer. It includes the interviewer’s question and any directly related answers or follow‑up questions that stay on the same topic. A segment must be self‑contained: it does not refer to content of a previous segment or need any information from other segments to be fully understood.

Rule 2: A new segment begins only when there is a clear change of topic or a completely new question that shifts the focus of the conversation to a different topic. Follow‑up questions that stay on the same topic are part of the same segment.

Rule 3: Segments are between 1 minute and 5 minutes long.

Rule 4: There must be no overlap between segments and no captions left unassigned.

Rule 5: The output must always be a JSON list of objects, where each object contains:
- "caption_indices": the list of indices of the captions that belong to that segment.

Rule 6: You must always validate that the segments created are not too short or too long and are in accordance with the definition defined in rule 1.

Verify for each new segment whether its first question introduces a completely new topic. If not, merge it with the previous segment.

Output format (strictly):

[
{{
    "caption_indices": [0,1,2,3]
}},
{{
    "caption_indices": [4,5,6,7,8]
}}
]

Do not give any introduction, explanation, comments or closing statements. Just valid JSON.

You are given several text segments from an interview. 
Each segment is shown with an index in square brackets, for example [0].

Select only those segments that are meaningful and relevant to **World War II**,
strictly following these rules:

Rule 1: A segment must contain substantial content directly related to World War II:
  - events, historical situations
  - organizations, groups, or locations
  - personal experiences, eyewitness accounts
  - names of relevant people or places

Rule 2: The topic related to World War II must be explicitly mentioned or clearly
the main focus of the segment. Segments where the connection to World War II
is vague or only implied must be excluded.

Rule 3: A segment must be self-contained and make sense on its own without needing information from other segments.

Rule 4: Exclude segments that:
  - only mention the topic without adding new or informative content
  - only consist of short answers like “I don’t remember” or vague statements
  - consist only of a question without any meaningful explanation or answer

Rule 5: Do not select segments that are mostly meta-discussion (about the interview itself) or administrative details.

Rule 6: Include a segment only if it clearly contributes new, concrete, or detailed information about World War II.

Possible outcomes:
- None of the segments are relevant
- Some of the segments are relevant
- All of the segments are relevant

Output format:
Return a valid JSON object in this format:

{{
  "relevant_segments": [0, 2, 5, 6]
}}

Do not add any explanations, commentary, or text outside of the JSON.

Below that is a list of concepts from a World War II thesaurus.
Your task is to validate which concepts are clearly relevant to the fragment.

Follow these strict rules:

Rule 1: Only select a concept if the fragment is clearly about that topic.
Rule 2: Do NOT select a concept based on a single incidental word match; it must be central to the fragment.
Rule 3: If a specific event, place, or organization is mentioned, select the concept only if it is unquestionably referring to that concept.
Rule 4: If there is some relevance but you are unsure, you may include the concept with a lower score.
Rule 5: For each validated concept, include a confidence score between 0 and 1 (1.0 = very certain, 0 = very uncertain).

Output must be strictly in this JSON format and nothing else:

Below is a fragment from an oral history interview about World War II:

Below that is a list of controlled vocabulary concepts from a World War II thesaurus.

Your task:
- Identify ALL and ONLY the concepts from the list that represent the **main topics** of this fragment.
- Ignore side remarks, digressions or incidental mentions that are not central to the segment.
- For each selected concept, assign a confidence score between 0 and 1 (1.0 = very certain).
- Use only the concepts exactly as listed. Do not invent or modify concept names.

Rules:
1. Select a concept only if it represents a **key theme or subject of the fragment as a whole**.
2. Do NOT select a concept just because a word or detail appears; ignore passing or side details (e.g., mentioning a Bible does not make religion relevant).
3. If the fragment describes a specific example or event that falls under a broader concept,
   include that broader concept (even if the broader term is not explicitly mentioned) if it is in accordance with rule 1.
4. Do NOT include any concept with a score of 0.5 or lower.
5. Multiple concepts can be selected.
6. For specific named events (e.g., battles, razzias, massacres), select them only if it is 
   100% certain that the fragment refers to that exact event. If there is doubt, leave it out.
7. Never return concepts that are not present in the list.
